# SwiffPlayer Expat substitute

[CHOSEN, not recovered] Owner decision 2026-11-08: use official libexpat
1.95.0 as a documented substitute for DICE's modified Expat. Retail
`SwiffPlayer.dll` links a modified C++ parser whose exact source is no longer
available: James Clark's 1.x distribution site is gone and was not archived.
Retail differs from every published release inspected, including a 328-word
`namingBitmap` versus 320 and older xmlrole role numbering. See
[the identification report](../../../../docs/tracks/swf/expat-identification.md).
This dependency is not recovered DICE source or an exact retail match.

The known behavior difference is XML name-character classification: retail's
extra bitmap page 40 (words 320–327), referenced by the name page-table entry
for U+30xx, and differing name/name-start page-table entries admit additional
code points. The identification report's full BMP comparison found 385 additional
name-start classifications and 402 additional name classifications in retail;
none were unique to the official 1.95.0 tables. The substitute retains upstream
classification. Older role numbering also differs internally; no claim of
complete parser equivalence or an exhaustive behavioral-difference list is made.

## OpenBF2 integration

`config.h` is a separate OpenBF2 file, [CHOSEN, not recovered]. The build adds
this directory to the parser include path so upstream's `<config.h>` resolves
it. It selects native byte order, standard memory functions and narrow UTF-8
callbacks, with namespace processing and parameter-entity/DTD support disabled
as observed in retail. No upstream file is force-edited. The three C translation
units are `xmlparse.c`, `xmltok.c` and `xmlrole.c`; `xmltok_impl.c` and
`xmltok_ns.c` are included fragments and must not be compiled independently.

CMake builds `bf2_expat_static` and links it to the macOS SwiffPlayer/client.
`Code/Build/swiffplayer.cmd` uses `/TC` and `lib.exe` for both MSVC x86/x64.
Every C compile selects `DEDICATED=0` and force-includes `Core/BuildConfig.h`.
The native C++ facade in `gameswf_xml.cpp` preserves the inspected create,
handler-storage and XML-load call sequence, adapting parser-owned state and
callbacks to the C API. It does not reproduce the retail parser layout or
30-slot virtual interface. All platforms use the recovered XML load behavior:
non-final input, status 0 only for parse result 1, parser release before onData,
and a String source argument even on parse failure. Existing S3 String/graph/VM
bridges remain chosen. The dependency does not enable the XML factories in the
action layer; publication and native teardown integration remain maintainer work.
