// [CHOSEN, not recovered] macOS port: the Cocoa application and window host. It stands where
// WinMain's message pump, the Win32 window class and the DirectInput event source stood on
// Windows. The header is plain C++ (no Objective-C types) so engine translation units can use it;
// the implementation is CocoaHost.mm. Design and integration notes: docs/macos-s2-4.md.
//
// Threading: every member must be called on the main thread, which is the thread that runs
// BF2::handleInGameWinMessages. Event callbacks are delivered synchronously from pumpEvents().
