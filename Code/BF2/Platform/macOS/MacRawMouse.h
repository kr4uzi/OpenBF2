// [CHOSEN, not recovered] macOS port: unaccelerated mouse motion from the GameController
// framework's GCMouse (macOS 11), the counterpart of the device counts a DirectInput mouse reports.
// Every connected GCMouse is observed (connect/disconnect at run time); their deltas are summed
// into one stream, as DirectInput's system mouse merges every mouse. Design and validation:
// docs/macos-c-raw-mouse.md.
//
// Threading: the GCMouse handlers run on a private serial dispatch queue (the single producer).
// Samples reach the engine thread through a lock-free single-producer/single-consumer ring with
// sequentially consistent std::atomic indices (docs/macos-s2-10-threads.md); CocoaHost drains it
// on the engine (main) thread in pumpEvents. Connection bookkeeping runs on the main thread.
